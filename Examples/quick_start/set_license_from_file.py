# set_license_from_file.py
# This example demonstrates how to set license from file.
# The SetLicense method attempts to set a license from several locations relative to the executable and GroupDocs.Viewer.dll.
# You can also use the additional overload to load a license from a stream, this is useful for instance when the 
# License is stored as an embedded resource.

        print("License set successfully.")
